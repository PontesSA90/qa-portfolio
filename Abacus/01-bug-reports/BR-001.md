# BR-001 — AbacusAI desktop window stops responding after sending second prompt

- **Environment:** Windows 11 / AbacusAI Desktop App / Date: 2025-12-12  
- **Pre-condition:** User is logged in; an existing conversation is open  
- **Affected application:** AbacusAI Desktop for Windows (main chat window)  
- **Frequency:** 3/3 attempts in a dedicated test and recurrently during regular usage  
- **Workaround:** Close the window via Task Manager or the Windows “Not responding” dialog and reopen the application

## Steps to reproduce

1. Open the AbacusAI desktop application and log in (if required).  
2. Open an existing conversation.  
3. Send a first short prompt and wait for the response to be fully displayed.  
4. Send a second prompt in the same conversation.  
5. Observe the behavior of the application window.

## Actual result

After sending the second prompt, the AbacusAI application window stops responding.  
Windows displays the message “The window is not responding” with the options “Reopen”, “Close”, and “Keep Waiting”.  
The user must close or restart the window in order to keep using the application. No apparent data loss occurs after reopening.

## Expected result

The application should process the second prompt normally without freezing the UI, displaying the response to the new prompt.  
In case of a failure, it should show a clear error message while keeping the window responsive.

## Evidence

## Severity

**High** — Blocks the use of the application in the current session, forcing the user to close/reopen the window during the main usage flow (sending prompts).

## Priority

**High** — Directly affects the main usage flow (chatting with the model) and significantly degrades continuous product usage.
