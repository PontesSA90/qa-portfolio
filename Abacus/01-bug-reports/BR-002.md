# BR-002 — Conversation tab rename option unavailable in AbacusAI

- **Environment:** Windows 11 / AbacusAI application (desktop and web) / Date: 2025-12-12  
- **Pre-condition:** User is logged in; at least one existing conversation is open  
- **Affected application area:** Conversation tabs (desktop and web)  
- **Frequency:** 3/3 attempts in a dedicated test and recurrently during regular usage  
- **Workaround:** None; it was not possible to manually rename the tabs.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Open AbacusAI (desktop app or web version) and log in if necessary.  
2. Open an existing conversation **or** create a new conversation.  
3. Confirm that the conversation tab is created with an automatically suggested name based on the conversation.  
4. Right-click on the conversation tab name.  
5. Try to use any option to rename the tab (if available in the context menu).

## Actual result

After creating a conversation, AbacusAI automatically assigns a name to the tab based on the beginning of the conversation.  
When right-clicking on the tab, there is an option related to renaming (or an expectation that renaming would be available), but the functionality remains unavailable / has no visible effect.  
The user cannot manually change the tab name.

## Expected result

The user should be able to manually rename the conversation tab at any time after it is created, for example:

- through a “Rename” option in the tab’s context menu, or  
- by clicking directly on the tab title to edit it in place.

This would make it easier to organize and identify multiple open conversations.

## Evidence

## Severity

**Low** — Does not prevent conversation usage, but makes it harder to organize and identify multiple open tabs.

## Priority

**Low** — Usability/organization improvement; can be treated as an enhancement in the backlog.
