# BR-004 — Blank lines inserted with Shift+Enter are ignored when sending the message

- **Environment:** Windows 11 / AbacusAI Desktop App / Date: 2025-12-13  
- **Pre-condition:** User is logged in; a conversation is open  
- **Affected application area:** Chat text input field  
- **Frequency:** 3/3 attempts  
- **Workaround:** The user needs to type characters to keep visual separation (for example, using only a single blank line or punctuation characters).

## Steps to reproduce

1. Open the AbacusAI desktop application and an existing conversation.  
2. Type a short text in the message field (e.g., “Paragraph 1”).  
3. Press Shift+Enter two or three times to insert multiple blank lines.  
4. Type another text (e.g., “Paragraph 2”).  
5. Send the message.  
6. Observe how the message is displayed in the conversation.

## Actual result

Although the text field allows inserting multiple blank lines with Shift+Enter, when the message is sent some of those blank lines are removed/ignored.  
The message shown in the conversation loses part of the visual separation the user had configured before sending.

## Expected result

Line breaks intentionally inserted by the user (including multiple blank lines) should be preserved in the sent message, keeping the same structure and spacing as seen in the editing field.  
This helps with readability and formatting of longer texts.

## Severity

**Low** — Does not prevent sending messages, but can reduce the readability of long messages and the user’s ability to format text freely.

## Priority

**Low/Medium** — Impacts user experience in longer messages; can be treated as a usability improvement.
