# BR-003 — No network failure warning when connection is lost during prompt submission

- **Environment:** Windows 11 / AbacusAI Desktop App / Date: 2025-12-13  
- **Pre-condition:** User is logged in; a conversation is open  
- **Affected application area:** Desktop app (message sending flow)  
- **Frequency:** Recurrent in tests with intentional network interruption  
- **Workaround:** After the network is restored, the app resumes working, but the prompt sent during the outage may be lost (there is no clear confirmation of submission).

## Steps to reproduce

1. Open the AbacusAI desktop application with an active internet connection and log in if necessary.  
2. Open a conversation and type a prompt.  
3. Start sending the prompt (click the send button or press Enter).  
4. While the prompt is being processed, interrupt the network connection (turn off Wi‑Fi or unplug the network cable).  
5. Keep the app open and wait a few seconds.  
6. Restore the network connection.  
7. Observe the behavior of the interface and the messages.

## Actual result

When the network connection is interrupted while a prompt is being sent, the application stops handling the command normally and does not display any clear message indicating a network failure.  
The user receives no visible error feedback or resend indication, and the prompt sent during the outage may be lost once the connection is restored.

## Expected result

When the network connection is lost during prompt submission, the application should:

- display a clear message indicating the connection failure (e.g., “Network error. Please check your connection and try again.”), and  
- keep the prompt text available for resubmission after the network is restored, or  
- clearly indicate whether the submission failed or will be automatically retried.

## Severity

**Medium** — The issue does not crash the application, but it can cause data loss (prompt sent during the outage) and leaves the user without understanding what happened.

## Priority

**Medium** — Impacts user experience in common network instability scenarios and may generate frustration and rework for the user.
