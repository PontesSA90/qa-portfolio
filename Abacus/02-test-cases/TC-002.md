# TC-002 — Enter and Shift+Enter shortcuts in the chat message field

- **Objective:** Verify the behavior of the Enter and Shift+Enter keys in the chat text input field.  
- **Environment:** Windows 11 / AbacusAI Desktop App  
- **Pre-condition:** User is logged in; a conversation is open.

## Test steps

1. Open the AbacusAI desktop application and open an existing conversation.  
2. Type a short text in the message field (e.g., “Hello”).  
3. Press the **Enter** key.  
4. Observe the behavior.  
5. Type another short text in the message field (e.g., “Test”).  
6. Press the **Shift + Enter** key combination.  
7. Observe the behavior.  
8. Insert multiple empty lines using Shift+Enter.  
9. Type additional text.  
10. Send the message.

## Expected result

- When pressing **Enter**, the message should be sent.  
- When pressing **Shift + Enter**, a new line should be inserted in the text field.  
- Multiple empty lines inserted with Shift+Enter should be preserved in the sent message, keeping the visual formatting.

## Actual result

- Enter sends the message.  
- Shift+Enter inserts a new line.  
- Multiple empty lines are ignored in the final sent message (this behavior is documented as an improvement request in BR-004).

## Status

**Failed** (due to the removal of empty lines, as described in BR-004).

## Notes

This test case fails because of the empty-line removal behavior, which is documented as a usability improvement in BR-004.  
The behavior of Enter and Shift+Enter for sending and inserting a new line, respectively, works as expected.
